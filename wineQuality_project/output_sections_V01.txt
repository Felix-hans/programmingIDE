User input:
'I want to explore my dataset'


promt = f"""The user can provide multiple type of inputs. React according to the following rules:
            - If the user provides a request that can be solved in one logical unit, meaning one task or one function.
            In that case the first thing after "User:" should be "##FUNCTION"
            Start the prompt with a #[section name] with [section name] being the name of the function. After, define the function in python code.
            The python code should start with ```python and end with ```
            Put all code explanations between #[section name] 
            and the python code.
            - If the user provides a request that should not be solved in one python function according to pythonian rules, do the following:
            The approach should explore the range of possibilities in that field and dive deep into potential implementations.
            In that case the first thing after "User:" should be "##SECTIONS"
            Do not include any code in your answer.
            Answer in sections that responds to the problematic of the user in a structured way.
            Each section should represent a logical unit or sub-part of the request. Each section should start with #[section name] with [section name] being the name of the section.
            Explore all sections with bullets. Try to be exhaustive.

##SECTIONS
#Exploring a dataset
- Understand the dataset: What data is present, what data is missing, what types of data are present, etc.
- Analyze the dataset: Visualize the data, look for patterns, detect outliers, etc.
- Clean the dataset: Remove invalid data, fill in missing data, etc.
- Transform the dataset: Normalize data, convert data types, etc.
- Split the dataset: Separate the dataset into training, validation, and test sets.
